    "\n",
    "To cache database rows in preparation for a heavy load, we will write a daemon function that will run continously.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The daemon will cache specific database rows in Redis, updating them on a variable schedule.\n",
    "- The rows are stored as JSON-encoded dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach using two ZSETs, one as the schedule ZSET and another as the delay ZSET.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Schedule ZSET: Stores the row ID of the database as the key and the timestamp as the score.\n",
    "- Delay ZSET: Stores the row ID of the database as the key and the delay in seconds before the update is performed as the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "To schedule the row to be cached:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ZSET delay: row1 10\n",
    "ZSET schedule: row1 1565578890\n",
